# CODSOFT
The tasks that I chose to work on are:
1. Chatbot with rule-based responses
   This project focuses on the development of a rule-based chatbot capable of providing structured responses. The chatbot leverages predefined rules to generate appropriate replies, enhancing user interaction.

2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
   In this project, I implemented an artificial intelligence system for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI employs strategic decision-making to compete against human players, showcasing its ability to make intelligent moves in the game.
   
3: Face Detection and Recognition
   For face detection and recognition, I have utilized a Google Colab notebook. The notebook provides an interactive environment to explore the implementation of face detection and recognition algorithms. The Google Colab link to the notebook can be accessed here. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_gbCYcr2lYb1pWYDlWQ2YhEk2E6kwUOJ?usp=sharing
